# Regular Expression: Password validation

Certainly in the world of coding (and also a world outside of coding) you have been asked to create a password that meets certain criteria. This tutorial will guide you through understanding and implementing a regular expression for validating passwords that adhere to specific rules. The regex pattern is designed to enforce the following criteria:

- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- At least one special character from the set: `*.!@$%^&(){}[]:;<>,.?/~_+-=|\`
- Must be 8 to 32 characters long

Let's break down the regex pattern:

```regex
^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[*.!@$%^&(){}[]:;<>,.?/~_+-=|\]).{8,32}$
```
## Summary

This regex pattern ensures that a password meets specific criteria, including the use of digits, lowercase and uppercase letters, and at least one special character. The length must be between 8 and 32 characters.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors assert a position in the string. In this regex, ```^``` asserts the start of the string, and ```$``` asserts the end.
<br><code>^</code>(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[*.!@$%^&(){}[]:;<>,.?/~_+-=|\]).{8,32}<code>&#36;</code></br>
### Quantifiers
Quantifiers define how many instances of the preceding element are allowed. ```{8,32}``` specifies that the password must be between 8 and 32 characters long.
### OR Operator
The OR operator, denoted by ```|```, allows for a choice between alternatives. This regex doesn't explicitly use the OR operator.
### Character Classes
Character classes match a single character from a set. ```[0-9]```, ```[a-z]```, and ```[A-Z]``` ensure the presence of digits, lowercase, and uppercase letters, respectively.
### Flags
Flags modify the behavior of the regex. This regex doesn't use any flags, but keep in mind that different programming languages may have their own set of flags.
<br>A simple example would be using ```i``` to match characters regardless of case sensitivity. ```'/abc/i'``` would match both 'ABC' and 'abc'.</br>
### Grouping and Capturing
<br>^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[*.!@$%^&(){}[]:;<br>,.?/~_+-=|\]).{8,32}$</br>
### Bracket Expressions
<br>^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[*.!@$%^&(){}[]:;<br>,.?/~_+-=|\]).{8,32}$</br>
### Greedy and Lazy Match
<br>^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[*.!@$%^&(){}[]:;<br>,.?/~_+-=|\]).{8,32}$</br>
### Boundaries
<br>^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[*.!@$%^&(){}[]:;<br>,.?/~_+-=|\]).{8,32}$</br>
### Back-references
<br>^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[*.!@$%^&(){}[]:;<br>,.?/~_+-=|\]).{8,32}$</br>
### Look-ahead and Look-behind
<br>^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[*.!@$%^&(){}[]:;<br>,.?/~_+-=|\]).{8,32}$</br>
