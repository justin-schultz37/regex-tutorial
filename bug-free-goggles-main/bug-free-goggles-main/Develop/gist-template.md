# Regular Expression: Password validation

Certainly in the world of coding (and also a world outside of coding) you have been asked to create a password that meets certain criteria. This tutorial will guide you through understanding and implementing a regular expression for validating passwords that adhere to specific rules. The regex pattern is designed to enforce the following criteria:

- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- At least one special character from the set: `*.!@$%^&(){}[]:;<>,.?/~_+-=|\`
- Must be 8 to 32 characters long

Let's break down the regex pattern:

```regex
^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[*.!@$%^&(){}[]:;<>,.?/~_+-=|\]).{8,32}$
```
## Summary

This regex pattern ensures that a password meets specific criteria, including the use of digits, lowercase and uppercase letters, and at least one special character. The length must be between 8 and 32 characters.
